              Opening activity: Media perspectives ice breaker 
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Ask your learners to think about a story they recently heard. This story could be from a friend, something they read on Twitter or heard on the radio, etc. </li>
              <li>Give your learners the following prompts: </li>
              <ol>
                <li>How would you translate that story using a different tool or storytelling method? For example, how might you tweet a story you heard from a friend?</li>
                <li>How could you change the tone of the story you heard to make it different? </li>
              </ol>
              <li>Have your learners share and discuss their ideas with a small group</i>

             Brief lecture: Introduction to framing 
            </h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Framing is how information is presented and how we interpret it. </li>
    <li>Faming mediates and shapes our understanding of information and it is how we tell stories. </li>
    <li>How a story is framed influences how it is understood and received, and understanding frames can help us be more critical of the media we consume and produce.</li>
    </ul>
    
      <h3>
          Brainstorm and discussion 
            </h3>
    <p>Ask your learners what contributes to framing - audience, the purpose of an article, technology, etc. </p>

             Group Activity Instructions 
            </h3>
            <p>In this activity your learners will look at a sample story and explore framing. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You will select two articles for this activity. You can use the two sample articles below, which both discuss the issue of self-driving cars. You can also select your own articles to use. Try to select a topic and articles that are somewhat controversial but not overly polarizing. Some sample topics could include space travel, housing issues in a city like San Francisco, social media, organic food, etc. </li>

              <li>Divide your students into small groups of about 4 people.</li>
              <li>Give half the groups one article, and half the groups a different article.</li>
              <li>Groups will read and discuss the framing issues they notice in their article. Have your groups take notes.</li>
              <li>Combine different groups and have them present and share their respective articles with one another.</li>

              <li>Have each individual learner select a topic of interest and explore framing in it. Tell learners to think about a hobby, a local topic of interest, something related to their major or favorite subject, etc. </li>
              <li>Tip: If your learners are having trouble selecting a topic or finding articles with their search, have them try searching with the sample topic you already used, or suggest they try one of the unused sample topic ideas listed above. </li>
              <li>Students will run a search (Google is fine for this) and see what articles they find.</li>
              <li>Have your students consider what frames they are seeing and how they might frame this topic for people to understand </li>
              <li>Have learners briefly discuss and share their topic ideas and findings in small groups.</li>
