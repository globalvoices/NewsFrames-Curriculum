            <ul>
              <li>Try running some sample searches in Media Cloud to familiarize yourself with the environment. </li>
              <li>You can also divide this lesson into smaller chunks to be completed over a series of class sessions. </li>
              <li>Be sure to factor in some time to have your students register for accounts with Media Cloud. This way they can save their searches. You could send out the link to have students register to accounts before your class as a way to save time. </li>

              <li>Activity prompt: How do you find information and refine a search? Where do you go to find information, and what steps do you take if you are not finding what you need?</li>

              <ul>
    <li>If you are not finding enough material you might need to broaden your search by using more general search terms or by searching for related topics.</li>
    <li>If you are finding and overwhelming amount of information you might need to narrow your search by using more specific search terms or looking at a specific person, place, time period, etc. </li>

          Media Cloud Overview

            <p>Media Cloud has different search tools you can use to explore topics. This lesson will introduce learners to the <a href="https://explorer.mediacloud.org/#/home">Explorer tool</a>,  which gives you a broad overview of a topic, and the <a href="https://topics.mediacloud.org/#/home">Topic Mapper</a>, which lets you take a deeper dive into investigating your topic. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use Media Cloudâ€™s built-in examples to demonstrate how searching in Media Cloud works in both the Explorer tool and the Topic Mapper tool. </li>  
              <li>Discuss how Media Cloud results can help you explore framing in a topic and craft a narrative on framing itself since it gives you a broad overview of a topic across time and outlets.</li>
