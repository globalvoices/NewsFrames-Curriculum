             <h3>
              Opening Activity: Evaluation Exercise
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Use one of the sample articles from <a href="https://globalvoices.github.io/NewsFrames-Curriculum/activities/lesson1.html#step-3">Lesson 1</a>.</li>
              <li>Have students review the article and work together in small groups to develop criteria that they would use the evaluate the article for both credibility and relevance (i.e. would this article be useful in a research paper?). </li>
              <li>Have groups share out some of their criteria. </li>
            </ul>
           
            
              <h3>
              Opening Discussion
            </h3>
            <p>Discuss evaluating information, evaluating frames (for instance, some frames might be problematic), and evaluating information needs and how they can be interconnected</p>
               <ul>
              <li>We can evaluate information for a variety of purposes. </li>
              <li>Evaluating information for credibility can involved looking at the author and publisher, fact checking claims, and checking sources. </li>
              <li>Evaluating information needs can be a way for you to understand your own purpose in finding and using information (such as to support your side in a debate, to write a research paper that makes a certain claim, or to answer a question). This can also be a way to help you understand whether or not the information you found is going to be useful to you. </li>
                  <li>Evaluating frames can be a way to take a broader look at an article and understand how it is presented and the effect that presentation has on people’s understanding.  </li>
            </ul>

       <h3>
              Annotated Bibliography Activity 
            </h3>
             <ul>
              <li>Students will select 2-3 articles from their searches in the Media Cloud environment and will evaluate those articles in three areas: information quality and credibility, their own information needs, and framing.  </li>  
              <li>Have students use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkiqqqDFFuADyBZrcwkDWQSSsJboEOSNz3wYIBReTTU/edit?usp=sharing ">Annotated Bibliography Activity Worksheet</a> to complete this activity.  </li>
              <li>Have students work in small peer review groups so they can share progress, ask questions, and get feedback as they work.  </li>
            </ul>

            Planning a NewsFrames Article  
            </h3>
             <ul>
              <li>As a closing activity, review <a href="https://newsframes.globalvoices.org/investigations/getting-started-with-investigations/ ">NewsFrames article guidelines</a> and criteria and have students brainstorm how they could turn their search and research into a piece.</li>

 <h3>
              Reflection questions for learners
            </h3>
              <ul>
               <li>What are some criteria you can use to evaluate an article?</li>
               <li>What are topics or approaches you'd be interested in turning into a NewsFrames style article?</li>
             </ul>
             
             <h3>
               Next Steps 
             </h3>
             <p>Now that you and your learners are more familiar with the tools and concepts that underpin NewsFrames, you might be interested in continuing your explorations. </p>
             <ul>
              <li>As a next step, consider having your students write their own story on the topics they researched using NewsFrames checklists. See <a href="https://newsframes.globalvoices.org/2018/03/17/how-to-start-your-newsframes-exploration/">How to Start Your NewsFrames Exploration</a> for an overview of the writing process and visit <a href="https://newsframes.globalvoices.org/investigations/getting-started-with-investigations/">Getting Started with Investigations</a> to see an overview of the type of articles produced on the NewsFrames platforms. </li> 
               <li>Consider having your students select an article type they want to write, or consider having your students complete multiple writing exercises using NewsFrames article types as a starting point. </li>
               <li>You can also visit the <a href="https://credibilitycoalition.org/">Credibility Coalition</a> to see opportunities for fact checking projects that you and your students can get involved with in the future. </li>
